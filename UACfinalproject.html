<div class = "words">
<p>By now, much of the fervor of the United States' unaccompanied child migrants has died down. Between January and September 2014, over 45,000 children who entered the United States alone have been transferred from detainment facilities to more permanent homes throughout the country. In general, these children live with their families while they await deportation proceedings. Many may ultimately be forced to return to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>But the United States is not the only country that has been faced with an influx of children migrating to its borders alone. As many as <a href="http://www.iss-ssi.org/2009/assets/files/others/Unaccompanied_children-ISS-Final_report-23June_2008.pdf">100,000</a> unaccompanied minors are estimated to live in the European Union, many of whom with their entire families outside Europe.</p>
<p>The countries have contended with these young migrants in a variety of ways. In France, a European country with a long history of immigration, children, including unaccompanied child migrants, are not legally allowed to be deported. They are also allowed to seek custody in the foster care system. Since France's child protection system is under the responsibility of the <i>départéments</i>, or counties, that means that local governments must house, clothe, feed and educate thousands of unaccompanied minors. Last year, the country adopted a <a href="http://www.textes.justice.gouv.fr/art_pix/JUSF1314192C.pdf">resolution</a> that shuffled its unaccompanied child migrants to different counties based on population: The more young people live in a county, the more unaccompanied minors are sent there. Some activists have complained that the children are treated like chess pieces, but Marc Brzegowy, the head of the task force devoted to the resolution, said, "Is it fair? Everything is relative. What's fair is that we host them."</p>
<p>So what would it look like if the United States used a system like France? Well, obviously, none of the 68,000 children who came to the United States this year could be deported. Further, they'd all be sent to different states' foster care systems based on how many young people already lived there. For example, Vermont, which has relatively few young people, would receive the smallest number of unaccompanied child migrants; California, which has the greatest number young people would receive the most.</p>
<p>As one would suspect, a hypothetical change like this one would mean that almost every state receives more unaccompanied child migrants than it does now. It also means that some of the state rankings would not change. For example, Florida receives the fourth-greatest number of child migrants currently; that would remain true. In some ways, this isn't a surprise. Because many of the children who came alone to the United States this year <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/20/fact-sheet-unaccompanied-children-central-america">were from Central America</a>, this is in some ways a question of where Central Americans live - and the answer is partly that they live where everyone else lives. So there are a lot of people from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala in New York, Texas and Florida, and not a lot in, say, Montana.</p>
<p>But there are some states that would shift greatly in the rankings. California, for example, is ranked lower than its population would suggest. Maryland is ranked much higher. And Washington, DC currently has about three times the number of unaccompanied minors than it would have otherwise.</p>
<p>Is it better for states - or counties, in France's case - to share responsibility for the care of these children? Or is it better for children to be with the families that they've joined? Ultimately, it's unlikely these countries will swap systems; these are two countries with very different histories and connections to immigration and minors; France's unaccompanied minors typically don't come with plans to reunite with family members. But perhaps it is always interesting to see how other countries organize their worlds.</p>
