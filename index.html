Data issued by the U.S. Census has found that, while many states had seen a decrease in the number of empty houses from the depths of the recession, 39 states had a greater number of vacant lots in 2012 than in 2005. And itâ€™s hardly the states with troubled cities, like Michigan or the Rust Belt, or those most implicated in the housing bust, like Arizona and California, who have seen the greatest change. New Hampshire and Idaho have nearly doubled their percentage of year-round vacant homes, while South Carolina and Florida have the highest percentage of houses without residents.</p>
