<h3>What would it look like if the United States handled unaccompanied child migrants in the same way that France does?</h3> 
<p>This March, I set out to work on my thesis on unaccompanied child migrants, in France, unaware that a different batch of children would create political turmoil across the Atlantic. For a brief moment this summer, the United States caught a glimpse of the unaccompanied child migrants and refugees making their way into this country; the children were ultimately dispersed to different cities and states, generally with their families.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I initially became fascinated with the question of unaccompanied child migrants in France was the way the hexagon takes care of them. These children are eligible for custody in France's equivalent of a foster care system wherever they arrive, no matter their nationality, until they turn 18, at which time they can be deported. And because the foster care system is in the hands of France's <i>départéments</i>, or counties, certain counties were charged with the care of hundreds of child migrants, while others had none. Last year, the government changed that plan, releasing a resolution that ordered proportionality in the foster care system. The new plan states that each county should have the same percentage of unaccompanied child migrants as it has total percentage of minors. So, if Paris has 5 percent of the population under the age of 19, Paris should receive 5 percent of the unaccompanied child migrants of that year.</p>
<p>In order to show what it would look for the US to absorb all of its unaccompanied child migrants into its own foster care system, I plan on building an interactive map like <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/10/dunkin_donuts_map_what_america_would_look_like_if_our_state_borders_were.html">Slate's Chick-fil-A map</a> through which viewers could see where the US's unaccompanied child immigrants live now and where they would live in France's current plan.</p>
<p>The project would require me to have a substantial amount of data on unaccompanied child migrants: <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-border-unaccompanied-children">the number of children who entered the United States by themselves last year</a>, <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/programs/ucs/state-by-state-uc-placed-sponsors">where they live now</a>, <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/entryexit2011.pdf">the number of children currently in each state's foster care system</a>, and <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/download/DataSet.txt">how many young people live in each state</a>. However, because the data does not perfectly correspond with the same time periods, I will likely need to contact Border Control and Health and Human Services to receive numbers by month, instead of numbers by year, and to confirm that the 20,000-person difference between HHS's numbers on where child migrants are now and Border Control's numbers are due to deportations.</p>
<p>On the French side, I have spoken with several child migrants, social workers, jurists, government employees, researchers and non-profit workers, as well as a UN representative, politician, judge, physician and documentary filmmaker. I have also spoken with the press person for <a href="http://www.supportkind.org/en/">KIND</a>, a non-profit that provides legal defense for child migrants. For the American side, I will also seek contact with child migrants, their parents, and researchers.<p>
<p>In order to create a successful project, I would need to learn how to make an interactive map, as well as to concatenate numbers on Excel for fips codes. For some reason, my attempts to combine numbers like "01" and "001" have led Excel to spit out "11" instead of "01001", for example.</p> 
<p>This would ideally accompany my thesis, so good places to publish this piece would be places like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera America</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us">the Guardian</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/matter">Matter</a>.</p>
