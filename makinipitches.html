<h3>What would it look like if the United States handled unaccompanied child migrants in the same way that France does?</h3> 
<p>This March, I set out to work on my thesis on unaccompanied child migrants, in France, unaware that a different batch of children would create political turmoil across the Atlantic. For a brief moment this summer, the United States caught a glimpse of the unaccompanied child migrants and refugees making their way into this country; the children were ultimately dispersed to different cities and states, generally with their families.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I initially became fascinated with the question of unaccompanied child migrants in France was the way the hexagon takes care of them. These children are eligible for custody in France's equivalent of a foster care system wherever they arrive, no matter their nationality, until they turn 18, at which time they can be deported. And because the foster care system is in the hands of France's <i>départéments</i>, or counties, certain counties were charged with the care of hundreds of child migrants, while others had none. Last year, the government changed that plan, releasing a resolution that ordered proportionality in the foster care system. The new plan states that each county should have the same percentage of unaccompanied child migrants as it has total percentage of minors. So, if Paris has 5 percent of the population under the age of 19, Paris should receive 5 percent of the unaccompanied child migrants of that year.</p>
<p>In order to show what it would look for the US to absorb all of its unaccompanied child migrants into its own foster care system, I plan on building an interactive map through which viewers could see where the US's unaccompanied child immigrants live now (and how many have been deported), where they would live based on France's old plan, and where they would live in France's new plan.</p>
<p>The project would require me to have a substantial amount of data on unaccompanied child migrants: the number of children who entered the United States by themselves for the last fiscal year, how many have been deported, and where they live now. I would also need demographic data from each county, specifically how many people aged 18 and below live in each county, how many people under the age of 18 live in the United States, and the basic math to calculate each state's proportion, which I could do myself. To make the data set complete, I also may need data for the number of children in the foster care system by state.</p>
<p>Because I conceived as this project as one that would accompany my thesis, the French sources for the journalism is pretty much done. I have also spoken with the press person for <a href="http://www.supportkind.org/en/">KIND</a>, a non-profit that provides legal defense for child migrants. It would also help me to speak with child migrants themselves, their families, attorneys who work with child migrants, social workers, and ESL teachers.<p>
<p>A lot of the data I'd need could come from the government: <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-border-unaccompanied-children">the U.S. Customs and Border Control</a> (total number of unaccompanied child immigrants), <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/programs/ucs/state-by-state-uc-placed-sponsors">the Office of Refugee Resettlement</a> (where UACs went), <a href="http://www.census.gov/en.html">the Census</a> (total populatiom numbers) and <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/resource/afcars-report-21">the Children's Bureau of ACS</a>. However, much of the data is in time frames that don't match, so I'll probably need to call the government bureaus for more comprehensive numbers as well.</p>
<p>This would ideally accompany my thesis, so good places to publish this piece would be places like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera America</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us">the Guardian</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/matter">Matter</a>.</p>

<h3>Do European countries that spend more on "integration" policies actually have better relationships with immigrants?</h3>
<p>After austerity, immigration is possibly Europe's biggest preoccupation. Countries have taken different approaches to this phenomenon, but do these immigrants ultimately become European? Or do they become permanent outsiders? I'd want to look at exactly this phenomenon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.justice.gouv.fr/_telechargement/rapport_mineur_20100510.pdf">A 2010 French government report</a> lists statistics for European funds for "integration" between 2007-2013. I would cross those numbers with data from <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/statistics">OECD</a>, <a href="http://www.un.org/en/databases/">the UN</a> and <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/employment_social_policy_equality/migrant_integration">Eurostat</a> to find out whether the finances have any correlation for <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-factbook-2013/unemployment-rates-of-native-and-foreign-born-population_factbook-2013-table26-en">unemployment rates</a>, health outcomes, <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Migration_and_migrant_population_statistics">citizenship rates</a>, educational attainment for their children and housing.</p>
<p>I would also speak with sources like <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/">Migration Policy Institute</a>. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">the European Commission</a> and perhaps individual government offices responsible for integration, especially to understand what these different policies are.</p>
<p>This would be good for publications that work a lot on issues relating to Europe and/or migration, such as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/">BBC</a> and <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/">France24</a>.</p>

<h3>Where is my NYU money going?</h3>
<p>NYU is one of the most expensive schools in the country, amidst a number of expensive schools in the country. While <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-18/college-tuition-costs-soar-chart-of-the-day.html">much has been written</a> about the soaring cost of college tuition over the years, I think many people would like to account for why exactly higher education in the United States costs so much, and whether funding is apportioned differently today compared to in the past.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like a dollar-by-dollar rundown on where NYU's tuition and fees, per student, goes. NYU keeps its operating budgets <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/budget/fiscal-2013-budget/operating-budget-charts.html">online</a>, though it's a bit vague; the website has all the budgets from 2009-2013. I would need another source from before then, and to color in the details for the operating budget.</p>
<p>Interview sources would be other NYU students, administration and faculty.</p>
<p>This would probably be a good fit at a publication that specializes in education, like <a href="http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5">the Chronicle of Higher Education</a> or one interested in policy and social justice, like <a href="http://mic.com/">Mic</a>.</p>
